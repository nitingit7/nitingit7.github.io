The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. 2. The incident ray, reflected ray, and the normal all lie in the same plane. These rules are independent of the shape of the reflecting surface. Therefore, the correct answer is all three: (A), (B), and (C)."

Required Condition: The total distance between the man and his image must reduce to 5 m. Let the man walk x meters toward the mirror. His new distance from the mirror will be $$(10-x)$$. The total distance between the man and his image will now be $$2 \\times (10-x)$$. Setting this equal to the desired distance: $$2 \\times (10-x) = 5 \\Rightarrow 20 - 2x = 5 \\Rightarrow 2x = 15 \\Rightarrow x = 7.5$$. The man must walk 7.5 meters toward the mirror."
