      "text": "The study of ageing is known as",
      "options": ["Oncology", "Gerontology", "Teratology", "Ornithology"],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Gerontology (B)**\n\nGerontology is the multidisciplinary scientific study of the ageing process in humans, covering biological changes (cellular senescence, telomere shortening, oxidative stress), psychological aspects (cognitive decline, mental health in elderly), and sociological dimensions (elderly care policies, retirement, intergenerational relationships). It is highly relevant for DRDO CEPTAM-11 as it tests precise terminology in life sciences and connects biology with modern issues like India's ageing population and defence-related human factors research (soldier longevity, stress management). Understanding gerontology helps in distinguishing it from clinical geriatrics.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **Oncology (A):** Branch of medicine dealing with tumours and cancer — completely unrelated to ageing.\n• **Teratology (C):** Study of congenital birth defects and developmental abnormalities during embryogenesis.\n• **Ornithology (D):** Scientific study of birds — a zoological sub-discipline with no link to human ageing."

      "text": "Pedology is the science related to the study of",
      "options": ["Atmosphere", "Soil", "Pollutants", "Seeds"],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Soil (B)**\n\nPedology (from Greek 'pedon' meaning soil) is the scientific discipline that studies the formation, classification, physical and chemical properties, morphology, and ecological significance of soils. It is critical in agriculture, environmental science, and defence applications (soil mechanics for construction of bunkers, airfields, and understanding terrain for military operations). For DRDO exams, this tests precise nomenclature in Earth and life sciences.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **Atmosphere (A):** Meteorology or atmospheric physics.\n• **Pollutants (C):** Environmental toxicology or pollution science.\n• **Seeds (D):** Seed technology or spermatology — unrelated to soil science."

      "text": "Study of bones are under which branch of science?",
      "options": ["Osteology", "Orology", "Serology", "Geology"],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Osteology (A)**\n\nOsteology is the detailed anatomical and forensic study of the skeletal system — bone structure, development (ossification), pathology (osteoporosis, fractures), and applications in anthropology/archaeology (determining age, sex, stature, trauma from skeletal remains). It is vital for DRDO-related fields like forensic science, human factors engineering, and palaeoanthropology in defence research.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **Orology (B):** Study of mountains (orography) — physical geography.\n• **Serology (C):** Study of blood serum, antigens, and antibodies (immunology/forensics).\n• **Geology (D):** Study of Earth's rocks, minerals, and physical structure."

      "text": "The study of snakes is known as",
      "options": ["Serpentology", "Ornithology", "Herpetology", "Ichthyology"],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Serpentology (A)**\n\nSerpentology (or ophiology) is the specialized zoological branch dedicated exclusively to snakes — their classification, venom composition, behaviour, ecology, and medical importance (antivenom development, snakebite management). India being home to highly venomous species (cobra, krait, viper), this topic frequently appears in DRDO CEPTAM for testing applied biology and toxicology knowledge.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **Ornithology (B):** Scientific study of birds.\n• **Herpetology (C):** Broader study of reptiles and amphibians (includes snakes but not specific).\n• **Ichthyology (D):** Study of fishes."

      "text": "What does the philatelist do?",
      "options": ["Collects the coins", "Collects stamps", "Collects the pictures of birds", "Collects the feathers"],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Collects stamps (B)**\n\nA philatelist is a person who studies and collects postage stamps as a hobby or for scientific value (postal history, printing errors, thematic collections). Philately is considered the world's most popular hobby and teaches history, geography, and design — useful in DRDO for general awareness and logical reasoning sections.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **Collects coins (A):** Numismatist.\n• **Pictures of birds (C):** Ornithologist or bird photographer.\n• **Feathers (D):** No standard term; sometimes part of ornithological collections."

      "text": "Find out the odd one out from the following.",
      "options": ["Physiology", "Psychology", "Pathology", "Bacteriology"],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Psychology (B)**\n\nPhysiology, Pathology, and Bacteriology are all core biological/medical sciences dealing with normal body functions, diseases, and microorganisms respectively. Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behaviour, falling under behavioural/social sciences rather than pure biology — a common odd-one-out question in DRDO CEPTAM to test classification of scientific disciplines.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• Physiology, Pathology, Bacteriology belong to biological sciences.\n• Psychology bridges natural and social sciences."

      "text": "What is hydroponics?",
      "options": ["Plant without soil enrichment", "Grafting plant", "Study of vegetables", "Soil conservation"],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Plant without soil enrichment (A)**\n\nHydroponics is a soilless cultivation technique where plants are grown in nutrient-rich aqueous solutions with inert supporting media (perlite, rockwool). It allows precise nutrient control, higher yields, water conservation, and is used in space research (NASA) and urban vertical farming — highly relevant for DRDO's defence agriculture and sustainability research.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **Grafting (B):** Vegetative propagation method.\n• **Study of vegetables (C):** Olericulture.\n• **Soil conservation (D):** Pedology or soil conservation science."

      "text": "What is lithotripsy?",
      "options": ["Art of writing on stones", "Breaking of kidney stone through rays", "Carbon dating of stones", "Trimming stones for household use"],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Breaking of kidney stone through rays (B)**\n\nLithotripsy (Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy) is a non-invasive medical procedure using focused ultrasonic shock waves to fragment kidney or gall bladder stones into sand-like particles that pass naturally through urine. Developed in the 1980s, it revolutionized urology and is a classic example of applied physics in medicine — important for DRDO's medical electronics and defence health research.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **Art of writing on stones (A):** Epigraphy.\n• **Carbon dating (C):** Radiocarbon dating technique.\n• **Trimming stones (D):** Masonry or sculpture work."

      "text": "Match List-I with List-II and select the correct answer... (a) Birds (b) Inheritance (c) Environment (d) Fossil",
      "options": ["1 3 4 2", "3 4 2 1", "4 2 1 3", "2 4 1 3"],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: 3 4 2 1 (B)**\n\nCorrect matching: (a) Birds → Ornithology (3), (b) Inheritance → Genetics (4), (c) Environment → Ecology (2), (d) Fossil → Palaeobiology (1). This matching question tests core biological disciplines and their precise definitions — a favourite pattern in DRDO CEPTAM for assessing conceptual clarity in life sciences.\n\n**Why important:** Accurate pairing helps in understanding interdisciplinary links (e.g., genetics in evolution, ecology in conservation)."

    {
      "text": "Darwin's theory of natural selection is based on",
      "options": ["Over production", "Struggle for existence and variation", "Survival of the fittest", "All of the above"],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: All of the above (D)**\n\nDarwin’s theory (1859) is founded on four interconnected postulates: overproduction of offspring, struggle for existence due to limited resources, heritable variation among individuals, and survival/reproduction of the fittest. These lead to descent with modification. For DRDO exams, this tests complete understanding of Darwinism versus Lamarckism.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• Each individual option is a key postulate; only 'All of the above' captures the full mechanism."

    {
      "text": "Who propounded the theory of evolution?",
      "options": ["Spencer", "Darwin", "Wallace", "Huxley"],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Darwin (B)**\n\nCharles Robert Darwin, along with Alfred Russel Wallace, proposed the theory of evolution by natural selection in 1859 through “On the Origin of Species”. Darwin provided extensive evidence from Galápagos, fossils, and artificial selection. In competitive exams like DRDO CEPTAM, Darwin is credited as the primary propounder due to his comprehensive work.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• Spencer coined “survival of the fittest” but applied it to society.\n• Wallace co-discovered but published later.\n• Huxley was a defender, not originator."

      "text": "According to recent proof, the life on earth emerged approximately",
      "options": ["Before 20,000 years", "Before 2,00,000 years", "Before 20,00,000 years", "Before 2,000,000,000 years"],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Before 2,000,000,000 years (D)**\n\nFossil evidence (stromatolites by cyanobacteria) and molecular clocks indicate life originated around 3.5–4.0 billion years ago; the question’s “recent proof” refers to conservative estimates of ~2 billion years for widespread prokaryotic dominance and oxygenation. This timescale is fundamental for DRDO science questions on origin of life and early Earth conditions.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• Options A–C are within human evolutionary timescale and incorrect."

    {
      "text": "Which is the oldest organism on earth?",
      "options": ["Blue-green algae", "Fungi", "Amoeba", "Euglena"],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Blue-green algae (A)**\n\nCyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are the oldest known living organisms with undisputed fossil evidence (stromatolites) dating back ~3.5 billion years. They performed oxygenic photosynthesis, fundamentally changing Earth’s atmosphere and enabling aerobic life — a cornerstone concept in evolutionary biology for DRDO exams.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• Fungi (~1 billion years), Amoeba and Euglena (eukaryotes, ~1.5–2 billion years) are much younger."
    },
    {
      "text": "Who explained first the evolution of life?",
      "options": ["Newton", "Einstein", "Charles Darwin", "Lamarck"],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Lamarck (D)**\n\nJean-Baptiste Lamarck (1809, “Philosophie Zoologique”) was the first scientist to propose a coherent, systematic theory of evolution based on use/disuse of organs and inheritance of acquired characters. Darwin later provided the mechanism of natural selection. This chronological fact is frequently tested in DRDO CEPTAM.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• Newton and Einstein are physicists.\n• Darwin refined the theory but was not the first."
    },
    {
      "text": "The mutation theory of evolution was enunciated by",
      "options": ["Huxley", "Darwin", "Lamarck", "Hugo de Vries"],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Hugo de Vries (D)**\n\nHugo de Vries (1901) proposed the Mutation Theory based on sudden, large, heritable changes (mutations) observed in Oenothera lamarckiana, challenging Darwin’s gradualism. It introduced the concept of saltation in evolution — important for understanding modern genetics in DRDO science syllabus.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• Huxley supported Darwin.\n• Darwin advocated gradual variation.\n• Lamarck proposed acquired characters."

    {
      "text": "With reference to the evolution of living organisms, which one of the following sequences is correct?",
      "options": ["Octopus - Dolphin - Shark", "Pangolin - Tortoise - Hawk", "Salamander - Python - Kangaroo", "Frog - Crab - Prawn"],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Salamander - Python - Kangaroo (C)**\n\nThis sequence correctly follows vertebrate phylogeny: Amphibia (Salamander) → Reptilia (Python) → Mammalia (Kangaroo), reflecting the evolutionary transition from aquatic to terrestrial life and advanced endothermy. DRDO exams test such phylogenetic understanding regularly.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• Other options mix unrelated groups or reverse evolutionary order."
    },
    {
      "text": "The main factor of evolution is",
      "options": ["Mutation", "Achieved quality", "Vaginal birth", "Natural selection"],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Natural selection (D)**\n\nNatural selection, as proposed by Darwin, is the primary driving force of adaptive evolution — differential survival and reproductive success of individuals with favourable heritable variations in a given environment. Mutation provides raw material, but selection shapes populations. This is a core concept repeatedly asked in DRDO CEPTAM.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• Mutation is source of variation.\n• Achieved quality and vaginal birth have no role in evolutionary theory."
    },
    {
      "text": "In the context of organic evolution, the loss of limbs in snakes is explained by the phenomenon of",
      "options": ["Use and disuse of organs", "Adaptation to living in burrows", "Natural selection", "Inheritance of acquired characters"],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Use and disuse of organs (A)**\n\nThis is a classic example from Lamarck’s theory — organs not used (limbs in burrowing snakes) gradually atrophy and disappear over generations through inheritance of acquired characters. It contrasts with Darwinian natural selection (advantage for burrowing). Important for understanding historical theories in DRDO syllabus.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• Natural selection is the modern explanation.\n• Others are related but not the direct phenomenon asked."

    {
      "text": "About whom is said 'India's large wild cat' has recently become extinct?",
      "options": ["Cheetah", "Leopard", "Tiger", "Lion"],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Cheetah (A)**\n\nThe Asiatic Cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus) was declared extinct in India in 1952 due to hunting and habitat loss. It was India’s only large wild cat species with that distinction. This fact is important for biodiversity and conservation questions in DRDO exams.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• Leopard, Tiger, and Lion still exist in India (though endangered)."

    {
      "text": "Latest ancestor of modern human is",
      "options": ["Java man", "Cro-magnon man", "Neanderthal man", "Peking man"],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Cro-magnon man (B)**\n\nCro-Magnon (early anatomically modern Homo sapiens) lived ~40,000–10,000 years ago in Europe and are the direct ancestors of all present-day humans, known for advanced tools, cave art, and culture. Java and Peking are Homo erectus; Neanderthal is a sister group. This is a standard question on human evolution in DRDO CEPTAM.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• Others are earlier hominins or side branches."
