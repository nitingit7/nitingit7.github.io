      "options": ["Oncology", "Gerontology", "Teratology", "Ornithology"],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Gerontology (B)**\n\nGerontology is the multidisciplinary scientific study of ageing processes in humans — including biological changes (cellular senescence, telomere shortening), psychological aspects (cognitive decline, mental health), and social dimensions (elderly care, retirement policies). It helps develop strategies for healthy ageing and addresses global challenges of increasing life expectancy.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **Oncology (A):** Study of cancer and tumours.\n• **Teratology (C):** Study of birth defects and congenital abnormalities.\n• **Ornithology (D):** Scientific study of birds.\n\nMastering this term connects biology with sociology and public health."

      "correctIndex": 0,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Osteology (A)**\n\nOsteology is the detailed anatomical study of bones — their structure, development, pathology, and forensic applications (age, sex, trauma determination from skeletal remains).

      "correctIndex": 0,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Serpentology (A)**\n\nSerpentology (or ophiology) is the specialized branch focusing exclusively on snakes — their classification, venom, behaviour, ecology, and medical importance (antivenom research). It is a sub-discipline of herpetology.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **Ornithology (B):** Study of birds.\n• **Herpetology (C):** Study of reptiles and amphibians (broader term).\n• **Ichthyology (D):** Study of fishes.\n\nSerpentology is crucial in toxicology and biodiversity hotspots like India."

      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Collects stamps (B)**\n\nA philatelist is a person who studies and collects postage stamps as a hobby or for scientific/historical value (postal history, printing techniques, rare errors). Philately is the world’s most popular hobby.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **Collects coins (A):** Numismatist.\n• **Pictures of birds (C):** Ornithologist or bird photographer.\n• **Feathers (D):** No standard term; sometimes part of ornithology collections.\n\nPhilately teaches history, geography, and design appreciation."

Psychology bridges natural and social sciences.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• Physiology, Pathology, Bacteriology are all biological/medical sciences.\n• Psychology deals with mental processes and is not purely biological.\n\nThis distinction is important in competitive exams testing scientific classification."
