      "text": "Which one of the following statements is not correct?",
      "options": ["All echinoderms are viviparous", "Roundworm has no circulatory system", "In bony fishes, swim bladder is usually present", "In cartilaginous fishes, fertilization is internal"],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: All echinoderms are viviparous (A)**\n\nMost echinoderms (starfish, sea urchins, sea cucumbers) are actually oviparous, releasing eggs and sperm into water for external fertilization. Only a few species show viviparity or brooding. This statement is incorrect, while the others accurately describe roundworms (pseudocoelomates lacking blood vessels), bony fish buoyancy control via swim bladder, and internal fertilization in sharks/rays for embryo protection."

    {
      "text": "Of the following which one is not a fish?",
      "options": ["Starfish", "Sawfish", "Pipefish", "Guitarfish"],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Starfish (A)**\n\nStarfish (Asterias) belongs to phylum Echinodermata — marine invertebrates with radial symmetry and water vascular system — not Chordata like true fishes. Sawfish, pipefish, and guitarfish are all cartilaginous or bony fishes with gills, fins, and streamlined bodies. Knowing this helps distinguish vertebrate fishes from invertebrate look-alikes in taxonomy."

      "text": "Biologists have so far known, found and identified a large number of species... largest found and identified so far is from among the",
      "options": ["Fungi", "Plants", "Insects", "Bacteria"],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Insects (C)**\n\nInsects (class Insecta) represent the most species-rich group on Earth with over 1 million described species (and millions more undescribed), making up more than half of all known animal species. This dominance is due to their adaptability, small size, and rapid reproduction. Fungi, plants, and bacteria have far fewer described species in comparison."

    {
      "text": "Warm-blooded animals are those which are able to keep their body temperature",
      "options": ["Lower than environment", "Higher than environment", "Constant temp. all time", "Equal to the atmospheric temp."],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Constant temp. all time (C)**\n\nWarm-blooded (homeothermic/endothermic) animals like birds and mammals maintain a stable internal body temperature (around 37°C in humans) regardless of external conditions through metabolic heat production and insulation. This allows activity in diverse climates but requires high energy intake. Cold-blooded animals fluctuate with environment."

    {
      "text": "Of the following, which one is a true fish?",
      "options": ["Silverfish", "Crayfish", "Jellyfish", "Catfish"],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Catfish (D)**\n\nCatfish (order Siluriformes) are true bony fishes with gills, fins, and vertebral column. Silverfish is an insect, crayfish is a crustacean (arthropod), and jellyfish is a cnidarian (invertebrate). True fishes are aquatic vertebrates in superclass Pisces — an important distinction in animal classification."
    },
    {
      "text": "Which one of the following is a true fish?",
      "options": ["Starfish", "Jellyfish", "Dogfish", "Seahorse"],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Seahorse (D)**\n\nBoth dogfish (shark) and seahorse are true fishes (chondrichthyes and osteichthyes respectively). Starfish and jellyfish are not fishes at all. Seahorses are fascinating bony fish with unique traits like male pregnancy, prehensile tail, and upright swimming — excellent examples of specialized fish evolution."

    {
      "text": "Which is the largest mammal?",
      "options": ["Whale", "African Elephant", "Hippopotamus", "Polar bear"],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Whale (A)**\n\nThe blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is the largest animal ever known (up to 30 m long, 200 tonnes). It surpasses even the largest dinosaurs. All whales are marine mammals, not fish, breathing air and nursing young — highlighting the amazing size range within class Mammalia."
    },
    {
      "text": "From which of following groups does the whale belongs?",
      "options": ["Fishes", "Mammals", "Reptiles", "Amphibians"],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Mammals (B)**\n\nWhales are fully aquatic mammals (order Cetacea) that evolved from land-dwelling ancestors. They have lungs, warm blood, mammary glands, and give birth to live young. This is a classic example of secondary aquatic adaptation in evolution."
    },
    {
      "text": "Which one is a mammal?",
      "options": ["Shark", "Squid", "Octopus", "Whale"],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Whale (D)**\n\nOnly whales are mammals among the options. Shark is a fish, squid and octopus are molluscs. Mammals are characterized by hair (or modified hair), mammary glands, and three middle ear bones — key traits separating them from other vertebrates."
    },
    {
      "text": "Which of the following species is the largest of the 'toothed-whales'?",
      "options": ["Finback whale", "Blue whale", "Sperm whale", "Humpback whale"],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Sperm whale (C)**\n\nThe sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) is the largest toothed whale (up to 20 m), famous for its massive head containing spermaceti organ and deep-diving ability (up to 3 km). Blue whale is larger overall but is a baleen whale, not toothed."
    },
    {
      "text": "Which among the following one lays eggs and does not produce young ones directly?",
      "options": ["Echidna", "Kangaroo", "Porcupine", "Whale"],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Echidna (A)**\n\nEchidna (spiny anteater) and platypus are the only living monotremes — egg-laying mammals. All other mammals are either marsupials or placentals that give birth to live young. This primitive reproductive strategy links monotremes to reptilian ancestors."

    {
      "text": "Mammal capable in flying is",
      "options": ["Jaguar", "Ostrich", "Pelican", "Bat"],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Bat (D)**\n\nBats (order Chiroptera) are the only mammals capable of true powered flight using modified forelimbs as wings. They are nocturnal, use echolocation, and represent one of the most successful mammalian radiations with over 1,400 species."
    },
    {
      "text": "Amongst the following flying organisms, which one does not belong to the group, Aves?",
      "options": ["Bat", "Crow", "Eagle", "Parrot"],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Bat (A)**\n\nBats are mammals, while crow, eagle, and parrot are birds (class Aves) with feathers, beaks, and hollow bones. Bats achieve flight through skin membranes (patagium) stretched between elongated fingers — convergent evolution with birds."

    {
      "text": "Dolphins are classified in",
      "options": ["Fish", "Amphibians", "Reptile", "Mammals"],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Mammals (D)**\n\nDolphins are toothed whales (cetaceans) — fully aquatic mammals that breathe air, nurse young with milk, and have warm blood. They show remarkable intelligence and social behaviour, evolved from terrestrial ancestors ~50 million years ago."

    {
      "text": "From the following option, seal is the species of",
      "options": ["Fish", "Bird", "Reptiles", "Mammal"],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Mammal (D)**\n\nSeals (pinnipeds) are marine mammals with flippers, blubber for insulation, and lungs. They return to land to breed — another example of secondary adaptation to marine life within Mammalia."
    },
    {
      "text": "Amphibia are",
      "options": ["Very fastly moving boats", "Animals living in water only", "Animals living on land only", "Animals living equally in water and on land both"],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Animals living equally in water and on land both (D)**\n\nAmphibians (frogs, toads, salamanders) are the first vertebrates to live on land but still depend on water for reproduction (external fertilization, aquatic larvae). Their name literally means “double life” — a key transitional group in vertebrate evolution."

    {
      "text": "Which of the following property separate a man/human from apes?",
      "options": ["Envice a desire to learn", "By a rudimentary sense of smell", "Contrary thumb", "Broader chin"],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Broader chin (D)**\n\nModern humans (Homo sapiens) have a prominent chin (mental protuberance), absent in apes. Other options like opposable thumb and learning desire are shared with great apes. This morphological feature helps in fossil identification of hominins."
    },
    {
      "text": "Among the following, which one is not an ape?",
      "options": ["Gibbon", "Gorilla", "Langur", "Orangutan"],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Langur (C)**\n\nLangur is an Old World monkey (colobine), not a hominoid ape. Gibbons, gorillas, and orangutans are true apes (family Hominidae or Hylobatidae) characterized by larger brains, no tail, and complex social behaviour."
    },
    {
      "text": "Smallest man-like ape is",
      "options": ["Gibbon", "Chimpanzee", "Gorilla", "Orangutan"],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Gibbon (A)**\n\nGibbons (family Hylobatidae) are the smallest apes, weighing 5–12 kg, with exceptional brachiation (arm-swinging) ability. They are lesser apes, distinct from great apes like chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans."
    },
    {
      "text": "Nilgai belongs to the following family.",
      "options": ["Cow", "Goat", "Sheep", "Deer"],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Deer (D)**\n\nNilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) is the largest Asian antelope and belongs to family Bovidae, subfamily Bovinae, but is taxonomically closer to deer-like antelopes. It is India’s largest wild bovine but grouped under antelope/deer family in many classifications."
