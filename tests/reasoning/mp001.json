      "text": "**Directions:** Study the following data carefully and answer the questions accordingly.\n\nThere are three buildings in a society i.e. **@, #, and $** from west to east in same order. Certain number of people live in these buildings. Floors are numbered in ascending order starting from **1 from bottom to top**.\n\n**Note:**\n• Each one has a different weight and people in ascending weight lives from bottom to top.\n• Weights are in consecutive numbers such that person living on top floor in **@** has a weight of **50 kgs** then person living on ground floor in **#** has weight of **52 kgs** and so on.\n• Total weight of all the people is **1350 kgs**.\n• Weight of a person is **2 kgs more** than the person living just below him.\n\nWeight of **L** is double of weight of **F**. **I** lives on top floor. **R** does not live on top floor. One person lives between **O** and **N**. **S** lives in **@** and has a weight in **perfect square number (when halved)**. **E** is **12 kgs heavier** than **J**. Total weight of **H** and **F** is same as the weight of **I**. **Three people live between C and D**. Number of people lives below **P** is **one less** than the number of people live above **G** but lives in **different buildings**. **6 people live between E and O**. **D** lives **four floors above G**. **U** lives **two floors above T** and weight of both of them is a **prime number (when halved)**. Total weight of **C and G** is **8 kgs less** than the weight of **Q**. **4 people live below Q**, who lives in **$**. **M and R** lives on **ground floors**. **Two people live between Q and P**, whose weight is **66 kgs**. **Three people live between M and J**. **W** lives just above **X**. **G** does not live in same building with **M and R**. Weight difference of **U and V** is **40 kgs**.",
