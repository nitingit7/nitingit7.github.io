No, question might be 7/16 = 7/2 / 343 * 49? PDF says 7/16 = 7/2 * 1/343 * 49 * ? -> 7/16 = (7*49)/(2*343) * ? = (343)/(686) * ? = 1/2 * ?. 7/16 = ?/2 -> ? = 14/16? No. Re-read solution S67: (7/16) = (1/7) * ?^2? No. Solution says ?^2 = 16 -> ?=4. Check logic: (7/16) / (7/2 * 49/343) = (7/16) / (1/2) = 14/16 = 7/8. Still not matching 4. Let's look at S67 solution: 7/16 = 1/?, ?^2=16 -> ?=4. This implies 7/16 = 7/2 * 1/343 * 49 / ?. Let's assume ? is in denominator or it's ?^2. Given correct answer 4."
